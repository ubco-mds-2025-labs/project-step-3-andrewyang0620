# Quizzing App DATA533

Group 3 Mebmers: ***Jingtao Yang***, ***Yiran Wang***, ***Zihao Zhao***

[**Project Presentation Video**](https://youtu.be/oRUMw0Y-9w0)

Our project is designed to be a Quizzing App that supports the full lifecycle of quiz creation, user management, quiz execution, scoring, and visualization. 

**The key features are:**

1. Question Creation & Management - supports multiple question types (MCQ, TF, SA) and includes functions to store, modify, and organize questions.
2. User (Quiz-Taker) Profile - support regular/prenium users, for creation/management of user profiles and manage past quiz scores
3. Quiz Session Excution - generate custimized quizzes with certain types of questions, manage question flow and get answer from quiz-takers
4. Quiz Scoring and Result Visulization - Compare answers from the quiz-taker and get the scores, create visualization of the result

The core app components are divided into 3 subpackages, and each of the subpackages has two or three modules for achieving the functions.

## Testing Coverage
This project includes automated unittests written using `unittest`, which covers all App modules. The `test_suite.py` combines all the test and run at once. 

The test coverage is measured using the `coverage.py` tool. We add a coverage.ini file to ensure the converted coverage percentage excludes files in `test/` folder.

We have achieved **93%** total coverage. The coverage report screenshot is below:

Here are the code for the test coverage:
```bash
coverage run -m pytest
coverage report
```

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ubco-mds-2025-labs/project-step-3-andrewyang0620.git

2. **Follow the prompts**: The application will guide you through each step
   - Select options by entering the corresponding number
   - Enter `q` at any menu to return to the previous screen

3. **User Mode**:
   - Register a new user profile
   - Create a quiz session and participate in it.

4. **Admin Mode**:
   - Add new questions
   - View all existing questions
   - Delete all questions
   - View all users
   - Delete all users

## Package Function Details

- `setUserInfo(self, name=None, age=None, email=None)` Updates personal information.
Only fields passed as non-None values will be updated.
- `getUserInfo(self)` Returns a dictionary containing full user profile information.
- `user_id, name, age, email, grades (list of numbers), profile_level (regular / premium)` Used when exporting profile data or showing user details.
- `addScore(self, score)` Adds a new quiz score to the user’s grade list.
- `getAvg(self)` Returns the user’s average score across all recorded quizzes. If the user has no grades yet, returns 0.0.
- `toDict(self)` Converts the user’s information into a dictionary for JSON saving.

-  Class: `RegularUser(User)` `__init__(self, user_id, name, age, email, grades=None` Initializes a RegularUser object. `profile_level = "regular"` Automatically sets in this.

- Class: `PremiumUser(User)``__init__(self, user_id, name, age, email, grades=None)` Initializes a PremiumUser object. `profile_level = "premium"` Automatically sets in this.


### *manage_user.py*
- `createUser(user_type, user_id, name, age, email, grades=None)` Creates a new user object based on the given user type.
- `user_type == "regular"` creates a RegularUser
- `user_type == "premium"` creates a PremiumUser

- `deleteUser(user_id)` Deletes a user from internal memory if its ID exists.
